# Instagram Log-in Page Creation!
This repository include the first ever HTML/CSS project, where I had to remake the Instagram log-in page.

### Main HTML page **_Index.txt_**
The **_Index.txt_** is the main HTML file. The page links into the CSS file by the link ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">``` in the header.

The **_Index.txt_** page contains one main div (parent class) called ```<div class="Main-Page">``` and within this div there are three child class called ```<div class="block hidden-div">```, ```<div class="block-1">``` and ```<div class="block-2">```. These div are created to set the page layout.

Inside each of the page layout div's, the sections are divided into many more div's to create the sections for each element on the webpage. The layout of each element is altered on the CSS file.
